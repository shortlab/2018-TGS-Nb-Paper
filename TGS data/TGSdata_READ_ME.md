The data is organized by irradiation level (0, 0.006, 0.02, 0.06, 0.6, and 1.9 dpa). For each irradiation level, 
there is data for each of three samples: the control, 1500 lb, and 2000 lb samples. Tungsten calibration data from all relevant dates
is in its own zip file. 

The files are the data output collected each time a measurement ("spot") is made with the transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) system
used in this paper. Because this is a dual-heterodyne system, we collect the negative and positive measurements simultaneously. Each
measurement records three traces. So, each spot results in six files: POS-1, POS-2, POS-3 and NEG-1, NEG-2, NEG-3. 

In general, the naming convention of the samples is as follows: 

                           SampleName_YYYY-MM-DD-gratingspacing-spot0#_###d-POS/NEG-1/2/3.
                           
The sample name indicates whether it is the control, 1500, or 2000 lb sample. The date helps match the data set to the appropriate tungsten 
calibration data (necessary to calculate the true grating spacing at the time of measurement). The grating spacing for these measurements
was generally 5.5$\micro$m, indicated in the file name as 05.50um. ###d marks the rotational position of the sample, as measured on a 
rotating stage. 

Because the data was collected over more than a year, naming conventions were not always consistent from day to day.
